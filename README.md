# MandelbrotRenderer
Real time interactive Mandelbrot set renderer.

I also found this to be really useful to manipulate images in a per-pixel scale.

To use it for other purposes, just create a canvas and a fragment shader with the same name.

The current Mandelbrot implementation is a rushed test, take a look at the TODO list.

Feel free to cooperate.
